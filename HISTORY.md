# RELEASE HISTORY

## 0.2.0 / 2013-01-06

Fixed broken namespace autoloads --damn thing seems rather tricker
than it should, but that's not atypical for Ruby at this level of
metaprogramming. Also tossed in `setup.rb` script, so autoload can 
be installed to act like an old-school standard library.

Changes:

* Fix issue with namespaced autoloads.
* Add setup.rb script to project.


## 0.1.0 / 2013-01-05

Honestly, I did not want to create this project, but sometimes the gods won't
hear our prayers. So we just have to take matters into our own hands.

Changes:

* Autoload is alive!
